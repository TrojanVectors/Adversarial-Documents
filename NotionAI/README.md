# Notion AI Adversarial Document Example

This directory contains an example of an adversarial document that demonstrates an indirect prompt injection attack on Notion AI.

## Documents

- **Document1:** The original document with actual content.
- **Document2:** The adversarial document with injected content, intentionally humorous to minimize potential misuse.
- **FluffDocuments (1, 2, 3):** Additional documents used for demonstration purposes. Feel free to modify or remove them as needed.

## Reproducing the Attack

### Step 1: Create a Baseline

1. Create a new workspace in Notion AI.
2. Upload **Document1** and title it "Document1". Copy the content into the document.
3. Upload the **FluffDocuments** in a similar manner.
4. Wait for Notion AI to index the documents (this may take some time). Save the workspace.
5. Open one of the **FluffDocuments**, avoiding **Document1**. Notion AI will search within the open document first.
6. Ask Notion AI: What is projected extra revenue for q4?
7. Notion AI should respond with the answer from **Document1** ($500 million).


### Step2: Execute the attack

8. Upload **Document2** to the workspace. Title of document - Document2 and copy the content.
9. Wait for some time so that Notion AI can index the documents. Save the workspace.
10. Open one of the **FluffDocuments**, avoiding **Document1** and **Document2**. Notion AI will search within the open document first.
11. Ask NotionAI this question - "What is projected extra revenue for q4?"
12. NotionAI should answer with the $420 million from **Document2**.


## Important Notes
- The content of Document2 is intentionally humorous and designed to minimize its potential use by malicious actors. Please be aware that a malicious actor could generate a more realistic and potentially harmful adversarial documents.
- Please reproduce this attack in your personal workspace for educational purposes only. Do not use it to create forced hallucinations to harm others.
